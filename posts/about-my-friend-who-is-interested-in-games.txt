You might have heard about my friend  who comes with me to Japan.
He is interested in purchasing some games but would like a list of the 
games you might have in Sega Saturn. Are you able to get the games from the 
Dragon Ball series for the sega saturn? 

### Playing the games in the USA.

My friend also wants to know if you are able to help them fix the system or 
games they would buy. 

### I will give you an example

A customer purchased a gamecube from you and after 3 months the system 
was not working. After a few troubleshooting methods over the phone. 
We agreed that the system needed to be fix manually by a technician

<span><i>How would you solve that problem?</i></span>
